10106 01 13116 cavahy, but as each trooper had two
servantS, who were themselves good horsemen and
provided with a horse, the actual cavalry strength was
sixty-one thousand two hundred. The cavalry tactics
01 1116 Galati are as follows: the servants remain
in the rear close at hand ; 11 a trooper had 1115 110156
killed, the servant brought him a fresh mount ; 11 1116
trooper himself was slain, the man mounted his
master's horse3 and 11 11115 man too fell, the third
servant in turn took his place in the fight. If the
master was wounded, one 01 1116 servants conveyed
him to the camp, while the other took his place in the
ranks. The tactics‚ it seems to me, were adopted by
the Galati 110111 1116 Persian corps 01 1116 Τ611 Thousand‚
known as the Immortals, but with this difference:
in the Persian corps the reserve 1611 111 after the
engagement, while with the Galati the reserve took
its place as wanted during the action, and thus kept
up the 11111 strength in the battle. This organisation
they called in their own tongue trimarcisia 1; 101 1110
Celtic word 101 a horse is marca. Such was the 10106
and such were the objects with which Brennus
invaded Greece.
