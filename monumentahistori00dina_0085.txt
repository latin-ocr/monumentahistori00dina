PYTHEAS 69

informed me that, not only at the summer solstioe,
but also during the days before and after that
seasonâ€š the sun at evening hides as it were beyond a
small hill, but in such a way that there is no darkness
even over the smallest space. In the middle of this
short space 01 time it is midnight at the equator3
and consequently these story-tellers are mistaken who
have written that round Thule the sea is frozen3 and
so also are they who write that 110111 the spring
equinox to the autumnal there is oontinuous day,
and on the other hand from the autumnal to the
spring equinox there is again oontinuous night.
Those who sailed to and stopped at this island in the
season of intense oold found alternate day and night
during their stay, except at the time 01 the solstioe 3
but they found the sea srozen at less than one day's
sail northwards.

XVI. Those who live on the aretio tropio (zhere,
aretio circle) have night lasting up to one hour 3 just
as they write that near Thule the sun goes round the
earth without setting day or night. As to those who
tell us that there is a day lasting six months and a
night 01 the same length, or, that certain northern
lands are never illuminated by the rays 01 the
sun, well, we will dismiss these writers for other
reasons.

XVII. Coneerning the island 01 Thule, whioh 15
said to have been visited by Pytheas the philosopher of
Marseilles, a story is told to the effect that the summer
sun is above the earth the whole day and coincides
