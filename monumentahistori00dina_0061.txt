EPHORUS 45

sunrisingS‚ and the Celts hold the country from the
summer· to the winter—sunsettings‚ and this is greater
by that difference and mostly opposite to it. The
territory inhabited by the Scythians occupies the
remaining space of the sun’s orbit, and is situated
opposite to the Ethiopian folk, and appears to extend
from the winter sunrisings as far as the shortest

sunsettings.
‘ The Ethiopians, most remote of men, are divided
in twain‚
‘ Some dweU towards the setting‚ others towards
the rising sun? 1
In his work on Europe Ephorus relates the old
opinion about Ethiopia ; that of the four quarters of -
the heavens and earth, the Indians occupy towards
the east, the Ethiopians towards the south, the Celts
towards the west, and the Scythians towards the
north : he adds that Ethiopia is larger than Scythia,
for it seems, he states, that the Ethiopian nation
extends from the winter sunrisings to the setfflngs,

and that Scythia is situated opposite to this,

Π. Ephorus extends the boundaries of Keltica
too far‚·2 including within it most of what we now
name Iberia, as far as the Gades. He states that the
people are great admirers of the Greeks,³³ and relates
- many particulars concerning them not applicable to
their present state. This is one z—That they are
very careful to avoid growing fat or big-bellied, and ,υ
that if any young man exceeds the measure of a certain

girdle‚ he is punished.
