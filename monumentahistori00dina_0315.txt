enemy than the allied tribeS, they answered the
Arevacae that Marcellus would declare in Iberia to

interests were such as the envoys of the allied tribes
suggested, and that the Arevacae were still inclined
to haughty independence, and that their own com-
mander was afraid of them: they therefore gave secret
instructions to the envoys of Marcellus to carry on
the war with spirit, and as the honour of the country
demanded. But when they had thus determined
on a continuance of the war, feeling no confidence in
Marcellus, they determined first of all to send a
connnander to relieve him in Iberia, as the new
consuls Aulus Postumius and Lucius Licinius Lucullus
had just taken up their office. They then entered on
their preparations with spirit and vigour, because they
believed that the Iberian question would be decided
by the result of this campaign: if these enemies
were beaten, they assumed that all others would
accept the orders of RomeÍ¾ but that, if the Are-
vacae proved able to ward off the punishment that
threatened them, not only would their spirits be
again raised, but those of all the other Iberian
tribes besides.
