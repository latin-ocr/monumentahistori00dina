POSEIDONIUS OF APAMEA 317

addressed to their deceased relatives for the dead
to read.1

VII. When travelling and in war they use tWo- ggiiie in
horse chariots, Which seat a driver and a warrior.

τ When they encounter horsemen in war they hurl

the javelin against the foe, and then dismounting

engage the enemy with the sword. Some of them so

utterly despise death that they expose themselves

naked with only a girdle around their bodies.2 They

bring with them freemen retainers picked from the

poorer class, and employ them as drivers and body-

guards in the fight. Before engaging in battle they

have a custom of going before the lines and challeng-

ing the bravest of the enemy to single combat,

branclishing their arms meanwhile for the purpose

of terrifying the enemy. If anyone accept the

challenge‚ they sing the prowess of their ancestors

and vaunt their own feats, while on their enemies

they pour abuse, and damp their ardour With their

vituperation. They cut off the heads of their fallen Human

foes, and attach them to the necks of their steeds. 'ro ”

The spoils stained with blood they hand to their

retainers to carry, and chant the hymn of victory.

They nail these trophies to the doors of their houses,

just as other people do With animals captured in

the hunt. *As-fegasdffitheheads--of the more famous⁴
