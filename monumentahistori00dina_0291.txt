LXVIII. It chanced that among the prisoners made
xus-&2 when the Rolnanssswon the victory rat Olympus over
ww& the Galatae of Asia, was Chiomara, wife of Ortiagom.
The centurion who had charge of her availed himself
of his ‚chance in soldierly fashion and violated her.
He was a slave indeed both to money and lust:
but eventually his love oi money got the upper hand ;
and, on a large sum of gold being agreed to be paid for
the woman, he led her off to put her to ransom.
There was a river between the two camps, and when
the Galatae had crossed it, paid the man the money,
and received the woman, she ordered one of them by
a nod to strike the Roman as he was in the act of
taking a polite and affectionate farewell of her. The
man obeyed‚ and cut off the centurion’s head, which
she picked up and drove off with, wrapped in the folds
oi her· dress. On reaching her husband she threw
the head at his feet ; and when he expressed astonish-
ment and said: ‘ Wife, to keep saith is a good thing,’
she replied: ‘YeS, but it is a better thing that there
should be only one man alive who has lain with me.' 1
. . . Desunt caetera.

Sardi& and was much struck with hor dignified demeanour and intelligence ’
