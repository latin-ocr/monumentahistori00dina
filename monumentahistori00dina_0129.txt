HIERONYMUS OF CARDIA 113

dwelt round the Malian Gulf to throw bridges over
the Spercheus. This they lost no time in doing, 101
they were urged 011 by a dread 01 Brennus and a desire
10 get the Barbarians out 01 their country, and thus
save it 110111 any further ruin. Brennus then led
his army across the bridges and marched on Heraclea.
The Galati did not reduce this city, but they plundered
the district, and slew all the 111011 they caught in the
fields, During the previous year the Aetolians had
compelled the Heracleans to join their League, and now
they protected the town as 11 11 belonged as much to
them as to its inhabitants, and saved it. But Brennus
cared little about Heraclea : his whole heart was set
on dislodgin g the enemy 110111 1110 passeS, and penetrat-
ing south 01 Thermopylae into the centre 01 Greece.

(2) He therefore advanced from Heraclea, and,
on being 111101111οᾶ by deserters 01 1110 strength 01 1110
Greek contingents at Thermopylae, in utter contempt
01 1110 Greek army, he offered battle at sunrise on
the following day. He had no Greek seer with him,
and he consulted no omens, 11 indeed the Celts practise
any art 01 divination.l The Greeks advanced in
silence and in good order. On joining battle the in-
fantry preserved their formation by not charging out
01 1110 ranks, while the skirinislierS‚ standing their
ground, hurled darts and plied their arrows and slings.
The cavalry on both sides was useless ; for not only
is the pass narrow, but the ground is smooth owing
10 115 rocky nature, and slippery owing to the many
streams that intersect it. The Galati were inferior as

Celts offer
battle.
