their hold over the rest 01 Italy, but even 10 reckon
on safety in their own city. Accordingly, while
sending envoys to Hasdrubal, and making a treaty
with him by which the Carthaginians, without
saying anything 01 the rest 01 Iberia, engaged not 10
01066 1116 Iber in arms, they pushed on the war with
the Celts in Italy.

VIII. This war 116611 I shall treat only summarily,
10 avoid breaking the thread 01 my history; but I
must go back somewhat in point 01 time, and refer 10
1116 period at which these tribes originally occupied
their districts in Italy. For the story I think is
worth knowing 101 its own sake, and must certainly
be kept in mind, 11 we wish to understand on what
tribes and districts Hannibal relied to assist him in
his bold design 01 destroying the Roman dominion. I
will first describe the country in which they live, its
nature, and its relation to the rest 01 Italy 3 101 11 we
clearly understand its peculiarities, geographical and
natural, we shall be better able to grasp the salient
points in the history 01 1116 war.

Italy, taken as a whole, is a triangle, 01 which the
eastern side is bound by the Ionian sea and the
Adriatic Gulf, its southern and western sides by the
Sicilian and Tyrrhenian Seas ; these two sides converge
to form the apex 01 1116 triangle‚ which is represented
by the southern promontory 01 Italy called Cocinthus,
and which separates the Ionian 110111 1116 Sicilian sea.
The third side, or base 01 11116 triangle, is on the north,

The Celtic
district 01
Italy.
