POLYBIUS ’ 221

next the enemy: and sending the Celtic contingents to ,

the other side, they pulled up the bridges 3 which at
once precluded any fear of danger from them, and left
themselves 110 hope of safety except in victory; the
impassable river being thus in their rear. These
dispositions made, they were ready to engage.
XXVII. The Romans 616 thought to have shown
uncommon skill in this battle 3 the tribunes instructed
the troops how they were to conduct themselves both
collectively and individually. They had learned
from former engagements that Gallie tribes were
always most formidable at the first onslaught, before
their courage was at all damped by a check3 and
that the swords with which they were 1111111611611, 66 Ι
116176 mentioned before, could only give one downward
cut with any effect, but that after this the edges got
so turned, and the blade 60 106111, that unless they
had time to straighten them 1171111 111611 1001 against
the ground, they could not deliver a 66601111 blow.
The tribunes therefore gave out the spears of the
Triarii, who are the last of the three rankS, to the
first ranks, or Hastati ; and ordering the men to use
their swords only, after their spears were done
with, they charged the Celts full in frent. When the
Celts had rendered their swords useless by the first
blows delivered on the spearS, the Romans closed

foes of the second Celtic invasion. Polybius, who was shown these swords,
also assigned them to the same source 3 for all memory of the first Celtic
settlers had been lost. Why were these swords bent? They we—re in-
tentionally bent in obedience to the same rite that commanded the Greeks
to place broken vases beside their dead. Cf. Reinaeh, L'Amhropoloqie,

1906, pp. 321-336.
