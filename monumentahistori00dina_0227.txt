effective in this state. At first the only actual
fighting was that 101 1116 possession 01 1116 11111 ; and.
the numbers 01 1116 cavalry, from all three armieS‚
that had joined in the struggle made it a conspicuous
sight 101 all. In the midst 01 11 1116 consul Gaius
1611, fighting with reckless bravery in the thick 01 1116
battle, and his head was brought to the king 01 1116
Celts. The Roman cavalry, however, continued the
struggle with spirit, and finally won the position and
overpowered their opponents. Then the 1001 also
came to close quarters. It was surely a singular and
surprising battle to witness, and scarcely less so to
hear described.

XXIII. A battle, to begin with, in which three
distinct armies were engaged, must have presented a
strange and unusual appearance, and must have been
fought under strange and unusual conditions. Again,
it must have seemed to a spectator open to question
whether the position 01 1116 Celts was the most
dangerous conceivable, from being between two attack-
ing forces 3 or the most favourable, as enabling them
to meet both armies at once, while their own two
divisions afforded each other a mutual support ;
and, above all, as putting retreat out 01 1116 question,
or any hope 01 safety except in victory. For this
is the peculiar advantage 01 having an army facing in
both directions. The Roman S, on the other hand, while

‚, encouraged by having got their enemy between two Appeamnce

01 111611 own armies, were at the same time dismayed gigig& m

by the ornaments and clamour 01 1116 Celtic host.
