ARISTOTLE 41

Immediately under the Bear (i.e. due north) beyond
the extreme limit 01 Scythia are the Rhipean moun-
tains, about the 51Ζο 01 which the bulk 01 the stories
told are mythical.

V. In the Ligurian territory a river not less than
the Rhone sinks under the surface, and rises again
in another place. But the river Rhone 15 navigable.

VI. In Illyria and Thrace and Epirus the asses are
small, while in Scythia and in the Celtic countriesthey
arenot found at all, for these lands are extremely 001(1.1

VII. Moreover the ass 15 a frigid animal, and
owing to its natural susceptibility to cold, will not
exist in cold countries, 511011 as Scythia and the
country bordering on it : nor indeed 15 110 found in the
Celtic lande beyond Iberia, because 01 the cold climate
01 those parts.

VIII. The brave man endures and performs brave
deeds from the motive 01 honour 3 but with regard to
excess, the man who 15 10011055 to οΧ0055 has no special
name, - because, as we have said before, many
qualities are unnamed,—unless we dub him mad or
· insensible, 11 110 fears nothing whatever, eg. 11 110
recks not earthquakes or waves, as 15 related 01 the
Celts 3 but οΧ0055 01 confidence in face 01 objects
01 terror 15 called temerity.

¹ The ass 15 not mentioned in In'sh literature before the sixteenth century.
MM. Bertrand and S. Reinach remark: ‘La 80110110, avec ses lacs dont
quelques-uns gelent facilement, est certainement le pays touchant aux
sources du Danube dont parle Herodote et qu’il attribue aux Celtas. Ges
pays sont relativement froids, c'est ce qui explique la reputation que la
Celtique avait du temps d’Aristote.’ (Les Celtas dans les Valldas da Ρό, &c.,
p. 183.)
