XXV. Poseidonius says that Marcus Marcellus fflfssffigijgf
exacted a tribute 01 600 talents from Celtiberia:
this proves the Celtiberians to have been a

that he saw in Spain bricks made of an argillaceous
earth, with which silver vessels are cleansed, floating
upon water.

Bosphorus has been derived from them, or to be more
correct the Cimbrian Bosphorus, for the Greeks call

formerly* inhabited the Hercynian Forest, and that
the Cimbri were repulsed by them when they made an
incursion into these parts, and driven towards the
Danube, and the country occupied by the Scordisci,
a Galatic tribe ; that thence they were driven to the
Tauristae or Taurisci, also a Galatic people3 and
