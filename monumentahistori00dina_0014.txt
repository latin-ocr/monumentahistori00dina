x PREFAOE

strides made in classica] research and criticism, quite
out 01 date. To A. Holder's scholarly work, Alt-
C'eltz‘sclzer Sprachschatz‚ the author wishes to express
his obligations, especially in the preparation of: the
etymologica] glossary at the end of Volume III. To
this monumentalwork all interested in Celtic Philology
are referred. To the researches of the late Mons.
D'Arbois de J ubainville, and to those of MM. Georges
Dottin, Ernault‚ Loth, S. Reinach, Alexandre Bertrand,
Karl Miillenhoffi and their fellow workers, the author
acknowledges his deep indebtedness. For his sym-
pathetic encouragement and advice the author owes
much to the late Mr. Alfied Nutt, whose untimely
death deprives Celtic studies of an enthusiastic and
generous friend. To his fellow-countryman, Mr. D. B.
Hurley‚ who has read the greater part of the transla-
tions and has supplied some, the author is particularly
indebted not only for the many corrections he has
made, but also for his illuminating criticisms of the
arrangement oi these materials.

It can hardly be hoped that a work entailing so
much reading and research would be free from errors
or omissions. If any are detected the author will be
much obliged to those who will kindly call his atten-
tion to them ; and, should a second edition be called for,
they and any useful suggestions that may be made
will be gladly availed of and duly acknowledged.
