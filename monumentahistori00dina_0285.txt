POLYBIUS 269

LX. ‘,'For said he,‘I{on1ans have never been

was the result 01 treachery on the part 01 the Celti-
berianS, and 01 rashness, the two commanders
getting cut off 110111 03011 other by their reliance on
these 111011.’

LXI. For owing to the populousness and wealth
01 1110 country, the droves 01 swine in Italy are
exceedingly large, especially along the sea-coast 01
1110 Tuscans and Galatae.

LXII. The approaches 01 these Celtiberes did a
great deal also to encourage the hopes 01 the Cartha-
ginians 3 101, instead 01 four thousand, it was reported
at Carthage that they were ten thousand, and that
their bravery and the excellency 01 111011 arms made

them irresistible in the field. . . . When the news ‚a

01 111030 proceedings reached the Roman camp Scipio
immediately determined to attack. . . . At the very
first charge the Numidians reeled before the Italian
cavalry, and the Carthaginians wavered before the
horse commanded by Massanissa3 101 111011 many
previous defeats had completely demoralised them.
But the Celtiberes fought gallantly, 101 they had no
hope 01 saving themselves by flight, being entirely
unacquainted with the country3 nor any expectation
01 being spared 11 they were taken prisoners on account
01 their perfidy to Scipio : 101 they were regarded as
having acted in defiance 01 justice and 01 111011 treaty
in coming to aid the Carthaginians against the
Romans, though they had never suffered any act 01
