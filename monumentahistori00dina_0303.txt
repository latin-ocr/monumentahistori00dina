POLYBIUS 287

at the town of Aegitna. . . . Having collected his
army at Placentia, Quintus Opimius marched over
the Apennines and arrived in the territory of the
Oxybii3 and pitching his camp on the river Apro,
awaited the enemy, being informed that they were
mustering their forces and were eager to give him
battle. Meanwhile he advanced to Aegitna,where the
ambassadors had been outraged, took the city by
assault, and sold the inhabitants as slaves, sending
the ringleaders of. the outrage in chains to Rome.
Having done this, he went to meet the enemy. The
Oxybiiâ€š convinced that their violence to the ambassa-
dors admitted of no terms being granted them, with all
the courage of desperation, and exeited to the highest
pitch of furious enthusiasm, did not wait to be joined
by the Deciatae, but, having collected to the number
of four thousand, rushed to the attack of their enemy.
Quintus was somewhat dismayed by the boldness of
their attack, and at the desperate fury of the Bar-
barians3 but was encouraged by observing that the
enemy were advancing in complete disorder, for he
was an experienced soldier and a man of great natural
sagacity. He therefore drew out his men, and, after a
considerable harangue, advanced at a slow pace to-
wards the enemy. His charge was delivered with great
vigour : he quickly repulsed the enemy, killed a great
many of them, and forced the rest into headlong fiight.
Meanwhile the Deciatae had mustered their forces,
and appeared on the ground intending to fight side by
side with the Oxybii 3 but finding themselves too late
