PY THEAs 81

XXX. Some say that philosophy has originated {hyetlffgiggd
among 1110 non-Greeks, 101 among the Pcrsians 111010 ’
were Magi, among 1110 Babylonians and Assyrians
were Ohaldecs, and Gynmosophists among the Indians.
Among the Celts and Galat-iaris were those called fx
Druids and 8011111011101, 33 13 stated by Aristotle in
his work on magic, and by Sotion in the 231rd chapter
01 1113 ‘ Oontinuation.'

 

XXXI. Germara: A tribe 01 1110 Celtic count-ry
who do not 300 the day, as Aristotle says in his work
on the IVonders 01 1110 World; and that the Lotos-
eaters sleep 101 siX months.

XXXII. Itis true that Pytheas of Marscilles affirms Sfirabo's criti-
that the 131111031 country north 01 1110 Β1·111311 island 13 00000
Thule ; 101 which place 110 says the summer tropic and
the arctic circle are one and 1110 331110. But he gives
no 011101 particulam, 1101 does he say whether Thule
is an island, or whether it 13 habitable up 10 1110 point
where the summer tropic is identical with the 310110
011010. For myself, I fancy the northern boundaries
01 1110 habitable earth are very much south 01 11113.

Recent writers make mention 01 nothing beyond

Ireland, which is just north 01 Britain, and where the

inhabitants lead a 1111301310Ιο and primitive existence 19 1”’Ῐ”ς., 0⁴3,

on account 01 1110 severe cold. In my opinion the ‘3‘’
limits 01 the habitable earth should be fixed here. . . .
But the truth is that Pytheas, who so frequently

misleads his readers, leads them astray here too}
