¹ Plutarch, Camillus, 41, copies this, and Polycn, Stratay. viii. 7, copies
from Plutarch. It is only in these Greek writers that we read of the bad
quality of Celtic swords. Latin writers made no mention of such a striking
defeet in the arms of their dreaded foe-s: on the contrary, Pliny quotes
from Varro that a Helvetian‚ named Helicon, resided in Rome teaching
the industrial arts of his native land. Archeologists are agreed that the
Celtic swords, &a of La Tene are of excellent iron. So are all those
to bc seen in our museum-s. S. Reina‘zh attempted to distort some Celtic
swords in the Mrsee de Saint-Germain, but found that no amount of
percnssion that a man could apply was sufficient to bend these swords.
How, then, was so carefnl a writer as Polybius niisled? We know that
the Celts settled in the Cisalpine, circa 1000 B.C. (see supra, p. 178,
note 1). ln their cemeteries, and in the cemeterics of these Celts all over
Europe, we find many examples of bent swords. Polybius visited the
Cisalpine after the Roman eolonisation consequent on the defeat of
the Celts related above. The Romam, after the fasliion of colonists, ran-

sackcd the graveS, &c. of the country. In them they found many bent
swords.2The graves and swords were attributed to their reeently defeated
