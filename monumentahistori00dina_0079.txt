planks, eat up the crumbs of one and scatter those of
the other. He whose crumbs are scattered lesos wius-‚s
his suit. But this story is too evidently a fiction.
What he affirms concerning Ceres and Proserpine is
more probable. There is an island, he says, near
Britain in which sacrifices to these goddesses are
performed in the same way as in Samothrace.

VII. There are some islands in the Celtic regions
which are known universally by the name Cassiterides
on account of their richness in lead. There is in the
British sea an island called Sena, opposite to the
shores of the Osismii and iamed for its oracle of a
Gallie god. It is said that the oracle has nine priest-
esses who are bound by a vow of perpetual chastity :
that the Gauls call them Senae‚1 and believe them to be
gifted with remarkable intelligence: that they can
raise up the waves of the sea and the winds with
their songs ; that they can assume the shape of any
animal they choose3 that they can cure complaints
that to others are incurable3 and that they know
and predict the future.2

writes that the island on which Ulysses met Circe is in the extremity of
Armorica.

Est locus, extremum qua Gallia litus
Oceani perfusus aquis, ubi fertur Ulysses . . .
(In Rus. i. 123.)

We find that the virgins of Sena correspond to OErce and her nymphs,
and the island of Sena is like Ea (accepting Claudian's geography) off
Armorica. Further, it is remarkable that no other text mentions pn'estesses
among the Gauls, while in the descriptions of the Germans (Caesar, Bell.
Gall. vi. 21, and i. 50; Tacitus, Hist. iv. 61 ; Germania, 8), who are always

implicitly, if. not explicitly, contrasted with the Gauls, the priestesses are
al ways mentioned.
