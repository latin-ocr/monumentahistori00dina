POLYBIUS 155

by the kind permission of Messrs. Macmillan, London,
the excellent translation of Polybius by Mr. E. Shuck-
burgh (in which Polybius expresses himself more
clearly than he does in his native Greek) is quoted
for the English version. Other books to consult are
Strachan-Davidson, Seleotions from Polybius (Oxford,
1888) ; Capes, H istory of the Archoeaii Leaque (London,
1888); Article in Encyclopoedia Britanniam Thirl-

wall, Historij os Greece, vol. viij.; and Engelmann,
Bibliotheca.

I. It was in the nineteenth year after the sea-
fight at Aegospotami, and the sixteenth before
the battle of Leuctra3 the year in which the Lace-
daemonians made what is called the peace of AntaL
cidas with the King of Persia ; the year in which the
elder Dionysius was besieging Rhegium after beating
the Italian Greeks on the river Elleporus3 and in
which the Gauls took Rome itself by storm and were
occupying the whole of it except the Capitol. With
these Gauls the Romans made a treaty and settlement
which they were content to accept : and having thus
become, contrary to all expectation, once more
masters of their own country, they made a start in
their career of expansion3 and in the succeeding
period engaged in various wars with their neighbours.

¹ ‘ This is according to the common computation 390 Β.ο.; but, in
fact, the capture of Rome occurred in Ol. 98, 1:388 13.c., and has been
thrown out of its proper place by the confusion of the Roman Calendar.'
Mommsen, H ist. os Rome (English trans„ London, 1901), vol. i. p. 428 note.
