PYTHEAs 83

XXXIII. [Pytheas] describes Thule and its neigh-
bourhood, where, according to his account, there is
neither earth, water, nor air, in a separate state,
but a kind 01 3213&oe 01 311 three, resembling a jelly-
fish, in which earth, water, and air and all things are
mixed, thus, as it were, uniting them all together.
One cannot travel over it, nor sail through it. He

affirms he saw this substance with his own eyeS‚ the
· other details he gives on hearsay.1

XXXIV. The history 01 Τ111110 1133 been specially
productive 01 fabulous stories. At the present time
many maintain that this is not the island known as
Icelaud, but one 01 the Orkneys; and in this they
follow Ptolemy, who has placed it four degrees on
this side 01 the polar circle. No doubt Pytheas
might be considered a liar 11 no land had been
discovered under the circle, 101 110 asserts that ‘ he
reached this land at the season when the summer
tropic was identical with the aretio circle, that is, the
qrecctest circle was constamly visible.' But considering
that we can now reach Iceland by ship, where the
tropic takes the place 01 the arctio circle, why should
we refuse to trust PytheaS‚ or to believe in the
existence 01 Thule, which he was the first to mention
by name Ζ The identification suggested and advanced
by others has not this condition, and 0100111οἀ03, more
accurately than Strabo, has left it where Pytheas is

said to have placed it. Το prevent anyone 110111
