III. Ptolemy would have hastened in pursuit, but
was unable owing to the following incident. When
making his preparations to resist the attack oi Magus,
he engaged, among other mercenaries, four thousand
Galati3 but he discovered that they were plotting
to seize Egypt, and conducted them to a barren isle
on the river, where they perishecl by one another’ s

ζ swords)and through hunger.

IV. When he (Pyrrhus) had rested his army after
their discomfiture in Italy, he declared war against
Antigonus, because he had failed to support him in
Italy, and for other offences He routecl the forces
of Antigonus and his Gallio mercenaries, and drove
them'into the cities on the sea-coast, while he made
himself master of Upper Macedonia and Thessaly.2
The importance of the battle and the decisive nature
of the victory of Pyrrhus are best shown by the Celtic
arms dedicated in the temple of Athena of Itonfnr,
between Pherae and Larisa, and bearing the following
inscription τ

‘Pyrrhus the Molossian king dedicated these shields
as a gift to Athena of Itonia.

From the intrepid Gauls he won them on the day on
which he overthrew the whole

Force of Antigonus. And no leer, for the

Aeacids are warriors now as of old.'
