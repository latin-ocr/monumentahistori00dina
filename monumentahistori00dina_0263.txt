accepting these assuranceS, and took great pains to
discover what their real intention and purpose were.
The Celts‚ however, professed to be fully aware of the
capture of the town, and the destruction of those who
had attempted to do him wrong3 and explained that
those events had induced them to come, because they
wished neither to inflict nor receive any damage ;
and finally promised to give him hostages. For a
long while Hannibal hesitated and refused to trust
their speeches. But at length coming to the con—
clusion that, if he accepted what was offered, he would
perhaps render the men before him less mischievous
and implacable—but that, if he rejected them, he
must expect undisguised hostility from them—he
acceded to their request, and leigned to accept their
offer of friendship. The Barbarians handed over
the hostages, supplied him liberally with cattle, and
in fact put themselves unreservedly into his hands3
so that for a time Hannibal's suspicions were allayed‚
and he employed them as guides for the next difficulty
that had to be passed. They guided the army
ior two days: and then these tribes collected
their numbers, and keeping close up with the
CarthaginianS, attacked them just as they were
passing through a certain difficult and precipitous
gorge.

been utterly destroyed, had it not been for the fact
that his fea-rs were still on the alert, and that, having
a prescience of what was to come, he had placed his

Hannibal's
great danger.
