HERODOTUS 33

Brongos, and the Brongos flows into the Danube 3 thus
the Danube receives both these large rivers : and from
the region which is above the Ombri, the river Karpis
and another river, the Alpis, fiow also towards the
north and run into it. For the Danube flows in faot
through the whole of Europe, beginning with the land
of the Celts who, after the Cynetes, dwell furthest west
of all the peoples of Europe. Thus flowing through
all Europe it falls into the §Q by the side of Scythia.

III. [A band of Lydians leave their territories to
seek more fertile lands and sail] until after passing
by many nations they came at last to the land of the
Ombri‚1 and there they founded eities and dwell up to
the present time.

IV. Let what has been said of the Hyperboreans
suffice: for the tale of Abaris,2 who is reported to have

the earth. If, however, there are Hyperboreans, it
follows that there are also Hypernotians ; and I laugh
when I see that, though many before this have drawn
maps of the earth, yet no one has set the matter forth
in an intelligent way, seeing that they draw Oeean
flowing round the earth, which is eiroular, exaetly as
if drawn with compasses ; and they make Asia of equal
size with Europe. In a few words I shall deelare the
size of each division and of what nature it is as regards

outline.
