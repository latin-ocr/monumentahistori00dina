city on the west of Etruria and inland to Arretium.
Next to them come the Etruscans 3 and tho next on

· both slopes the Umbrians. The distance between

the Apennines and the Adriatic averages about five
hundred stades; and when it leaves the northern
plains the chain verges to the right, and goes entirely
through the middle of the rest of Italy, as far as the
Sicilian Sea. The remaining portion of this triangle‚
namely the plain along the sea coast, extends as far as
the town of Sena. The Po, celebrated by the poets
under the name ol Eridanus, rises in the Alps near the
apex of the triangle, and fiows down to the plains
in a southerly course3 and after reaching the plains
it turns to the east, and flowing through them
discharges itself by two mouths into the Adriatic.
The larger part of the plain is thus cut off by it, and
lies between this river and the Alps to the head of
the Adriatic. In body of water it is second to no
river in Italy, because the mountain streams, descend-
ing from the Alps and Apennines to the plain, one and
all fiow into it on both sides ; and its stream is at its
height and beauty about the time of the rising ot'
the Dog Star (i.e. July 15), because it is then swollen
by the melting snows on the mountains. It is navig-
able for nearly 2000 stades up stream, the ships
entering by the mouth called Olana 3 and though it is
a single main channe] to begin with, it branches off
into two at the place called Triglbboli2 of Which
streams the northern is called the Pa( oa, the southern

the Olana.
