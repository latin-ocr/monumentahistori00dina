PREFACE ix

The story of the brave wife oi the Celtic leader,
Ortiagon, is first told by Polybius; Livy presents the
story in his most finished style ; Plutarch too cannot
resist its charm. The myth of Juno's geese saving
the capitol is repeated by a dozen writers. So, too,
with the histories of the various campaigns, the later
writers merely adopted the account given by their
predecessors. When the original account is available
it alone is quoted in these volumes.

The notes are as brief as it was possible to make
them, and are chiefly concerned with such commentary

as seems necessary for the proper understanding of ’

the text. The reader is referred to the index at the end
of the third volume, where he will find carefully noted
the various passages in which the tribes and customs
are mentioned in the excerpta. In the same volume will
be found a concise etymologica] glossary of the Celtic
names and terms occurring in the texts. The Tabala
Rerum Celticarum may also, it is hoped, prove useful.

In the Rerum qallz‘carum et francicarum scriptores

Britannica of Petrie and Hardy (1848), and in the

(1878-1892) attempts have been made to provide
Celtic scholars with useful treasuries of the oriqz'nes of
Celtic history ; but a comparison of the arrangement
and the contents of these works with the present
volumes will show that the author is under no obliga-
tions to these writerS, whose works—excellent‚ no
doubt, for their time—are now, owing tothhe great
