Rome derived from the previous war, which I have
described in my last book, with the express pur-
pose of enabljng my readers to follow my narrative.l
He therefore reckoned very much on the chance of
their co-operation 3 and was careful to send messengers
to the chiefs of the CeltS, whether dwelling actually on

promises; because he believed he would be able to
confine the war against Rome to Italy, if he could make
his way through the intervening difficulties to thosc
partS, and avail himself of the active alliance of the
Celts„ When his messengers returned with the report
that the Celts were ready to help him and all eagerness
for his approach, and that the passage of the Alps,
though laborious and difficult, was not, however,
impossible, he collected his forces from their winter
quarters at the approach of spring.
