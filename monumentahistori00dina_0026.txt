10 MONUMENTA HISTORICA OELTICA

was known to the ancients, but is now lost. Erato-
sthenes (circa B.o. 275—195), librarian to Ptolemy ΙΙΙ,
King of Egypt, translated this account into Greek,
but this work too is lost. Rufus Festus AvienUS‚
who was proconsul for Africa A.D. 366, and an elegant
writer of Latin, had a copy of the Greek version of
Himilco's work, and amused himself by rendering
it into Latin verse. Of this Latin translation, written
850 years after the events it narrates, we have a
fragment of some 4015 lines. These have been care—
fully published by Alfred Holder, under the title of
Rufi Festi Avieni Carmina.

It should be noted that at the time of Himilco's
expedition the Oelts had not conquered Spain.
Polybius 1 and, following him, Strabo 2 blame Erato-
sthenes for stating that the Celts held all Spain except
Cadiz, which belonged to the Carthaginians, and
then omitting the Celts from his list of peoples
occupying the west coast of Spain. There is, however,
no contradiction here. Eratosthenes, writing circa
Ro. 240, correctly states that the Celts held dominion
over the greater portion of the Iberian peninsula, but
when copying the account of the voyage of Himilco,
which relates to Ro. 500, he does not find the Celts
among the tribes occupying Iberia. We must conclude
they had not yet conquered the peninsula. We know,
however, from Herodotus 3 that about fifty years after
