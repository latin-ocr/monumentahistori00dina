152 MONUMENTA HISTORICA OELTIOA

POLYBIUs

Polybius (born circa 203 B.O., died circa 121 Ro.)
is the most important and trustworthy authority we
have 101 13116 history 01 13116 period 01 which he treats.

For him the object 01 historica] study was the
discovery 01 13116 truth3l thus only could history
become a guide to statesmen and people.² Rhetoric
did not appeal to him, and his literary style shows
him 130 have been a man who wrote ‘straight on,'
intent only on the matter 01 his composition. Free
110111 the spell 01 rhetoric, he was equally free 110111
racia] prejudice. A patriotic Greek, he incurred a
sentence 01 seventeen years' exile in Rome (13.0. 166-
149). This time was spent in the study 01 13116 records
preserved in the Roman archives, in acquiring the
friendship 01 the important men 01 Rome, and in
hunting, a pastime 01 which he was passionately
fond. To an outlook 1166 from prejudice, and to
a genuine love 01 truth, he joined a thoroughly
modern methbd 01 historical research. History above
all must explain the existing situation, and this
renders an investigation 01 the past necessary. For
this investigation Polybius is not satisfied with the
compilations 01 previous historians, but examines
anew the most authentic records available. Thus
we find him examining the archives at Rome,3 at
