POLYBIUS 257

Celts who lived in the fork 01 the Po and Trebia,
while pretending to have come to ternis with him,
were sending messages to the Romans at the same
time, believing that thus they would secure themselves
from being injured by either side, he sent two thousand
infantry with some Celtic and Nuniidian cavalry with
orders to devastate their territory. This order being
executed, and a great spoil captured, the Celts
appeared at the Roman camp beseeching their aid.
Tiberius had all along been looking out for an oppor-
tunity 01 striking a blow3 and at once seized on this
pretext 101· sending out a party, consisting 01 the
greater part 01 his cavalry, and a thousand sharp-
shooters 01 his infantry along with them3 who
having speedily come up with the enemy on the
other side 01 the Trebia, and engaged with them in a
sharp struggle for the possession 01 the booty, forced
the Celts and the Numidia-ns to beat a retreat to

their own camp.
