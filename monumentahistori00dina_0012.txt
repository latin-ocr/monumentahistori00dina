viii PREFACE

errors which disfigure too many of the works of our
Celtic scholarS, considerable pains have been taken to
arrange the materials of these volumes in chronolo- -
gical order. Each statement is, as far as it is possible
to do so, traced back to its author. The custom
among the Classical writers of quoting without acknow-
ledgcment from the works of earlier authors has given
modern scholars much trouble in identifying the
sources of their information, especially when the works
from which they quote are no longer extant. The
account given by Pausanias (second century A.D.) of
the invasion of Greece by the Celts is based on the
work of a writer of the third century Bo, and pro-
bably of Hieronymus of Cardia. It therefore appears
in these volumes under the date of its author, and
not under that of the copyist to whom we owe its
preservation.

The author wishes to acknowledge his indebted-
ness to the commentators who have laboured to
elucidate these problems, to whose works reference
is made as occasion demands. With very few excep-
tions the works that have come down to us from the
writers of Greece and Rome owe their preservation to
their literary style: they are chiefly polished com-
pilations based on the commentaries of soldiers who
described their fights in prose less stately no doubt
than Livyâ€™s, but which, had fate preserved them for us,
would have been of priceless worth to the historian.
The picturesque and the heroic appeared to these
ompilers most worthy of a place in their productions.
