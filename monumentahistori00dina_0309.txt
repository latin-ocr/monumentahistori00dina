LXXXIII. Near Aquileia, Polybius says, in the
territory 01 the Noric Taurisci, in my own time a gold
mine was discovered, so easy to work, that by scraping
away the surface soil 101 two ieet, gold could be
found immediately. The seam 01 gold was not more
than fifteen feet3 some 01 it was found unmixed
with alloy in nuggets 01 the size 01 0 100011 or
lupine, only an eighth 01 it disappearing in the
furnace3 but some 01 it required more elaborate
smelting, but would still pay very well. Accordingly,
on the Italians joining the Barbarians in working
this mine, in two months the price 01 gold went
down a third throughout Italy, and when the
Taurisci discovered that, they expelled their Italian
fellow-workers and kept the inonopoly themselves.

LXXXIV. The war between the Romans and <erce

Celtiberians was called the ‘ fiery war'3 for it was
01 0 peculiarly fierce kind and remarkable for the
frequency of its battles, The war's in Greece and
Asia were as a rule settled by one battle, or in rare
cases by two3 and the battles themselves were
decided by the result 01 the first charge and iinpact
01 the two armies. But in this war things were
quite different. As a rule the battles were stopped
only by the 1011 01 night; the men neither lost heart
nor would yield to bodily fatigue3 but returned
again and again with fresh vigour to renew the

character of
Celtiberian
