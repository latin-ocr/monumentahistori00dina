PYTHEAS 87

not Pytheas who is at fault in his diary, but Hippar-
chus, who, while professing to quote Pytheas, draws his
own conclusions, and asserts that the longest day in
North Britain contains eighteen hours. In the same
way Eratosthenes is at fault in enumerating the
neighbours of Britain. Moreover, he argues that the
statements of Pytheas concerning the Ostidamnii,
Calbium, and Uxisama (Ushant), and other places,
are fictitious 3 and, being unable to overcome his
dislike to Pytheas on account of Thule, he calls the
man an outrageous liar; and all because the men
who had seen Ireland did not relate their impressions
of an island of that kind, but only of the other and
Δ smaller islands around Britain. But how can we excuse
Pytheas when he claims ‘ to have traversed all Europe
to the Οοεαη, and from Gadiz to the 'Danais’ 12 Of
course, no one would deny that he might have coasted
along Spain, Gaul and Germany‚ and, perhaps passing
by Denmark, have penetrated far into the Baltic sea,
which was anciently believed to be the Sarmatician
and Hyperborean ocean, and thought also to surround
the Scandinavian islandS, which are now known to
be the continents of Norway and Sweden. But as
to his believing that he reached ‘ as sar as the Don,' well,
considering the ignorance of the time, how just it
is to overlook even this 1 .
