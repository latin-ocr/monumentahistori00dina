HOMER 3

called in Pliny, specula brundisium steel is in
Greek χάλυψ because it was obtained from the
Chalybes (Χάλυβες), a people in the Caucasian
district. The word κασσίτερος came to the Greeks
through the Phoenicians, who enjoyed a monopoly of
the tin trade in the Mediterranean.

The XIth extract seems to be best explained with
Merry and Riddell,²2 as a description of an iceberg.
The Phoenician sailors who came to the Cassiterides
for tin must have seen many icebergs, descriptions of
which they would not fail to give to the Greeks who
bought their cargoes. The XIIth extract shows a
knowledge of the short summer nights of the northern
latitudes, and this must have been obtained too
nom the Phoenicians.3

The evidence seems to justify the view that in
the ninth century Ro. the Gadhelic branch of the
Celtic family was estabh'shed in the British Isles and
engaged in the production of tin.
